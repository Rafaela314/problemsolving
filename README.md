# A collection of problem solving implementation in golang
 

There are place where programmers from all over the world come together to solve problems in a wide range of Computer Science domains such as algorithms, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, as well as to practice different programming paradigms like functional programming.

Solving challenges are not only fun but is also an excellent way to expand knowledge by learning new programming topics and exercising critical thinking.

Therefore, once in a while a update this repo with my solutions to challenges I feel excited about that are mainly found in:

- HackerRank
- Codility
- Cracking the Code Interview
- Kaggle

If you know other fun challenges platform, I would love to hear about It.
